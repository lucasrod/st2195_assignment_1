# ST2195 Programming for Data Science Assignment 1

This R Markdown file demonstrates how to source an external R script which prints integers from 1 to 10 as part of the ST2195 assignment. The process exemplifies how R scripts can be integrated into R Markdown for more complex workflows.

## Sourcing R Script

The following code block will invoke the `print_integers.R` script from the 'r' folder, which contains the code to print integers from 1 through 10:

```{r}
source("print_integers.R")
```
